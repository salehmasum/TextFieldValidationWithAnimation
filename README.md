# Text Field Validation With Animation
UITextField validation where feedback text is shown with nice little animation. Here the concatenation of translation and scaling animation has been applied to achieve the desired output.


## Description

This iOS Swift project is focused on creating an enhanced user experience by implementing UITextField validation with dynamic feedback. It provides instant user feedback through the use of animations when users interact with text fields. 

The key technical feature is the application of a concatenated animation sequence on the feedback text, involving translation and scaling animations. Translation refers to the motion of the text whereby it is moved to a new location. Scaling, on the other hand, involves altering the text's size by making it bigger or smaller.

The combination of these animations enhances visual communication between the application and the user, ensuring that any input errors are instantly noticed, leading to a more interactive, engaging, and user-friendly experience. 

All these have been accomplished using Swift, Apple's powerful programming language explicitly designed for iOS development, known for its efficiency and clarity.
